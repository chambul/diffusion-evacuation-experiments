268:


-most busiest ones are towards the end of the network, leading to the 5 safe points.
-picked several links that are in the middle of the network and have a considerable level of reroute cost (in terms of distance).
- 463: agents go to either 273(up) or 110 (down). so they use the alternative to their left (~10km) and reach at the end of 463.
- but blocking 349 they have no choice other than to go all the way round.

-reroute  distance cost: shorter the blocked link, and longer the alternative route/s results in higher costs
