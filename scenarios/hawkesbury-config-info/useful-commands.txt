to fix the sequence of person IDs in the population sample file created from the MATSim GUI, if it is helpful.
cat plansin.xml | awk '/person id=/{s=sprintf("\"%d\"", i++); gsub(/\".*\"/, s)} 1' > plansout.xml


xmlstarlet ed -L --update "//population/person/attributes/attribute[@name='distanceFromTheBlockageThreshold']" --value "20.0" ../../scenarios/hawkesbury/matsim-plans-gk4-zones-5.xml

cd to the latest directory
cd $(ls -t | head -n 1)


combine multiple files (e.g. images ) into a single pdf:
convert May26-*/plots-comparison/blocked_percept_times_comparison.png  blocked-agents-over-time-regular-network.pdf


search for any text you want to find:e.g. inactive agents, info received agents.
grep "removed agents" May26-*/analysis.out -> shows the file paths too, so we know the cases


cat files with the file path (for instance to find the scenario/dir):
tail -n +1  May31*/*/basic_stats.out

tail -n +1  Jun01-10*/*/basic_stats.out | grep "proactive" -> to just get exactly what you want rather  than looking at the whole file
